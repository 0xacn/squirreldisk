## What's taking your hard disk space?

The easiest app you will ever use to detect huge files. Built with Rust + React (Tauri).

## Disclaimer

This app was a project from 2 years ago built in Electron in 2 days, I decided to port it to Tauri to achieve better performances and to make it Open Source. Yay.

The code is still spaghetti and needs a lot of refactoring.
